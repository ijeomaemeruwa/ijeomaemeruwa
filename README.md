# Hey, it's Ijae :blue_heart:

<img src="ijeomaemeruwa.gif" alt="ijeoma emeruwa gif" />

I'm a self taught front end software developer who enjoys creating an accessible and optimized user experience on the web and mobile devices. I love everything design and an aesthetically pleasing user interface. Currently getting involved in open source, technical writing and a few back end technologies (Node, Express and SQL).

When I'm not geeking away on the web, you would find me thoroughly enjoying myself in a restaurant with great food :herb: or reading historical events.
