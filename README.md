I'm a self taught software developer who enjoys creating an accessible and optimized experience on the web. I love design and an aesthetically pleasing user interface. Currently getting involved in open source, technical writing and a few back end technologies (Node, Express and SQL).

When I'm not geeking away on the web, you would find me thoroughly enjoying myself in a restaurant with great food :herb:
